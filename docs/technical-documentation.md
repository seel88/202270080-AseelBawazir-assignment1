1. Software Testing (SWE 326)

Objective: Conducted fuzzing campaigns on the bzip2 utility using AFL++ in an Ubuntu environment.

Results:

Achieved 45.9% line coverage and 51.9% function coverage during compression testing.

Identified 2 unique crashes during decompression, which were analyzed as CRC integrity failures rather than memory corruption.

2. Database Systems (ICS 321)

Objective: Designed an Event Management System for university use, focusing on high data integrity.

Normalization:

Developed a Conceptual Design using an EER Diagram.

Successfully normalized the schema from 1NF through to Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) to eliminate transitive and partial dependencies.
