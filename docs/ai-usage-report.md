Tools Used: Gemini (AI Collaborator).

Use Cases:

Converted complex project reports for SWE 326 and ICS 321 into summarized web components.

Resolved CSS display issues to ensure technical diagrams (like the EER model) were not cropped.

Learning Outcomes: Learned to implement a Dark/Light theme toggle using CSS Variables and localStorage to maintain state.

Responsible Use: Manually verified that all project metrics, such as the 45.9% line coverage for SWE 326, remained accurate to the original data.
